    <h2>Our Vision and Plan</h2>
<p>Ethical Sustainable Properties (ESP) exists to create affordable, sustainable homes for committed campaigners as part of the transition to a fair, zero carbon society. ESP is a secondary housing co-op and ethical landlord, buying and managing property to allow dedicated, effective campaigners to live and work together to address the most pressing challenges of our times. The homes and communities ESP creates will be bastions of ethical and sustainable living, demonstrating best practice in insulation, energy efficiency, clean energy, food growing and responsible, regenerative living.</p>
<p>UK rents are now too expensive for most campaigners to afford. Many great campaigners are put off in the first place, leave the movement, or are forced to campaign less in order to cover exorbitant rents. By purchasing properties, ESP, as a secondary housing co-op, is able to charge truly affordable, below market rents whilst still ensuring all loans are repaid to investors and campaigners are supported to create secure, sustainable homes within a regenerative, empowering community.</p>
<h2 id="get-in-touchregister"><a href="/register/">Get In Touch</a></h2>
<p>How it works.</p>
<p>ESP buys and manages properties which offer the best value for money. For example, we renovate and retrofit neglected properties, initially using the skill and goodwill of the wider campaigning community, and over time setting up retrofit and eco-fit workers&rsquo; coops, creating highly rewarding jobs.</p>
<p>To achieve our vision of hundreds of these homes, weâ€™ll ensure we have more than enough monthly income to repay all our loans, invest in insulation, clean energy and the regenerative community re-fit.</p>
<p>As a secondary housing coop ESP will help to create primary housing coops which manage each property. Long-term, committed residents will become members of their primary housing coop which will have a 5 year lease and have the freedom to organise their home and community, supported by the secondary housing coop every step of the way.</p>
<p>Although we will always aim to keep all rents as low and affordable as possible, primary housing coops will be able to rent some rooms out at a higher, closer to market rate if, for example, there was a period where there were insufficient full time campaigners needing accommodation, or there was a pressing financial need which could best be met in this way. All funds raised will be used to repay loans, re-fit the properties and invest in future properties.</p>
<p>We have a team of highly experienced tradespeople including electricians, plumbers, carpenters, plasterers, gardeners and permaculture designers who are willing to not only undertake the work on our first two properties for free, but also train volunteer apprentices who are excited to learn the skills and get the experience whilst helping to renovate our properties</p>
